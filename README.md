# Job Kit - Job Search and Posting Mobile App

Job Kit is a mobile application that allows users to search for job listings, post job openings, and connect with employers or job seekers. Built with Flutter and integrated with Firebase, Job Kit provides a seamless experience for both job seekers and employers.

## Features

- **Search Jobs:** Users can search for available job listings based on keywords, location, and other filters.
- **Post Job Listings:** Employers can post job openings, including job descriptions, qualifications, and other relevant details.
- **Firebase Integration:** The app uses Firebase for authentication, database storage, and real-time updates.
- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles using Firebase Authentication.
- **Job Applications:** Job seekers can apply for jobs through the app, with their profile information and resume.
- **State Management:** The app uses [state management solution] to manage and streamline the appâ€™s UI and data updates across various components.

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter:** For building the cross-platform mobile app.
- **Firebase:**
  - Firebase Authentication: For user authentication (email, Google login).
  - Firestore: For storing job listings and user profiles.
  - Firebase Storage: For storing user-uploaded resumes and other files.
- **State Management:** [State Management Solution] for handling state across the app GetX

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- Firebase Project with Firestore, Firebase Authentication, and Firebase Storage set up
- [State Management Solution] installed , get

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job_kit.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd job_kit
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Set up Firebase:

- Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Add your Android/iOS app to the Firebase project.
- Enable Firebase Authentication (Email/Google) in the Firebase Console.
- Set up Firestore and Firebase Storage in your Firebase project.
- Download the `google-services.json` (for Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) and place it in the appropriate directory:
  - Android: `android/app`
  - iOS: `ios/Runner`

### 4. Set up State Management:

Install the state management package based on your choice. For example, to use `GetX`, add this to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  get: ^4.0.0
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 5. Run the app:

For Android:

```bash
flutter run --release
```

For iOS:

```bash
flutter run --release --ios
```

## State Management Overview

The app uses [state management solution] to handle the app's state efficiently. The state management system is responsible for managing user authentication, job listings, job search filters, and the job application process.

### Example Usage with [State Management Solution]:

#### 1. **Authentication State:**
Manage the user's authentication state (logged in, logged out) using [state management solution]. The authentication state is automatically updated across the app, ensuring the UI reflects the user's status.

#### 2. **Job Listings State:**
The app's job listings are fetched from Firestore and stored in a central state. This allows for seamless updates when new jobs are posted or removed without needing to refresh the UI manually.

#### 3. **Reactive UI:**
With [state management solution], the UI reacts to changes in state, such as when the user logs in or a new job listing is added. This ensures that the app feels fast and responsive.

## Usage

1. **Sign Up / Log In**: Users can sign up using their email or Google account. Once authenticated, they can access the app's features.
2. **Search Jobs**: On the homepage, users can enter job-related keywords and filter by location, category, or experience level.
3. **Post Job Listings**: Employers can post new job openings by providing details like job title, description, location, and requirements.
4. **Apply for Jobs**: Job seekers can apply for listed positions by submitting their profiles and resumes through the app.
